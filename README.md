# Ultimate ReactJS Netflix Clone Project 🚀

![HOME](/public/screenshots/homepage.png)

# How to use the Web App? 

1. Firstly, you will get to see the main home page as shown in the screenshot above. You can see my name just above the get started input field so that you can know that it is developed by me and not the original one...

   But other than that...I hope it looks like the real netflix application 🔥😄 Thats how I have developed it from scratch.

2. After viewing the Home page now click the get started button on the center of the page and you will see the SignIn component will popup in front of you..just the way shown below 👇🏻

3. Now within the SignIn component, type out your email adresss and password and hit 'SignUp now' button below the SignIn if you are signing up first time in my netflix clone project.

   Once you hit 'SignUp now', your user will be created in my firebase database that is attached to my project in the backend. Now the main page of netflix where you can view all the movies list will appear in front of you!!

   NOTE: Once you have created the user and details are already there in my database. Now in order to log back in my app you dont have to hit the 'SignUp now' as your user is already been created and is only for one time use. Now everytime you will click the signin button to log into the main movies page of this netflix clone.

   I have created the entire user signin/signup authentication functionalities so that people like you can enjoy testing my project with comfort ✓🧑🏻‍💻

4. Now, once you are logged in, BOOM!!🤟 The main netflix movies list page will appear in front of you. AND Believe me it looks just like the real netflix movies page along with real time movie list fetching functionality. Have alook at the screenshot 👇🏻😉

   Now, in the movies page you will see the netflix logo and the users section on the top just like the real app along with the main banner of real time movie detail fetching functionlity.

   YES!! YOU HEARD IT RIGHT.. as you refresh the page the movie detail will keep on changing in the banner section by randomly fetching the data from the Movies API_KEY that I have used in this project. All working real time.

   ALso all the movie lists that you see below the banner section that are divided into categories are absolutely dynamic and are fetched through the API_KEY real time. 
   
   HAVE A LOOK BELOW 👇🏻

   All the movie lists are scrollable along the x-axis just like the real Netflix app. It also has a nice hover effecr when you hover on each of the movies.

![MOVIELISTTWO](/public/screenshots/movieListTwo.png)

   I hope my Netflix clone app has around 5 different categories of movies listed one after the other and all are fetched dynamically through the API_KEY. Just a see a glance of it before using it real time in your browser.

   Just take a look below 👇🏻😉🧑🏻‍💻

# Important Notice:

Look, as the Netflix Clone Application is in testing about as it is just a showcase project so the realtime movies changing in the banner by refreshing the page can be a little slow and I am working on it. An Issue is also posted in the repository.

So while mounting the page by refreshing you can sometimes go back to the login page so if this happens then keep on refreshing again and you will go back to the main movies and a different movie data will show up on the banner. 

Just take a look of the last screenshot below 👇🏻🚀

# Technologies used in this Project:

1. The Entire Project is built on ReactJS Library.

2. Along with it I have used React Router Dom NPM Package to setup my routes of the multiple pages that are attached with the application. Like the home page and the movies page and the integration of the authentication logic of signin/signup with the help of dynamic routes.

3. Just to setup the user authentication system in the best way possible, I have used my favourite State Managemnet Library -- React-Redux and Redux Toolkit NPM package along with the login logout actions by creating a reducer, so that it works in the best way.

At last Note, I would like to thank you if you have studied the entire readme file and have viewed my project and if you have liked it consider starring the project and do provide me out with some cool suggestions thank you.

You can also follow me on github to stick to my future updates of my interesting projects.

Thank You..Have a great day ahead 🌞
