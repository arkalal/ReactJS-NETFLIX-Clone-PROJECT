# How to use the Web App? 

1. Firstly, you will get to see the main home page as shown in the screenshot above. You can see my name just above the get started input field so that you can know that it is developed by me and not the original one...

But other than that...I hope it looks like the real netflix application 🔥😄 Thats how I have developed it from scratch.

2. After viewing the Home page now click the get started button on the center of the page and you will see the SignIn component will popup in front of you..just the way shown below 👇🏻
